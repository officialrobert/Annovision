# Annotation flow

Annovision isn't that heavy of an app, we create an annotation file only when the user already selected/clicked that file.
You can read more of the output path [**here**](https://github.com/officialrobert/Annovision/docs/PROJECT.md)

For files import in a project, we adhere to pagination design in order not to populate your display and memory with unwanted data.
If you wish to switch pages edit input or increase/decrease page in app's right-panel
