# Annotation flow

Annovision isn't that heavy of an app, it creates an annotation file only when the user select/click that file.
You can read more of the output path [**here**](https://github.com/officialrobert/Annovision/blob/master/docs/PROJECT.md)

For files import in a project, the app's UI adhere to basic pagination design in order not to populate your display and memory with unwanted data.
If you wish to switch pages, feel free to edit input or increase/decrease page in app's right-panel.
